# RAG Pipeline (Learning Project)

## Overview
This project is a basic implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline created while learning from online tutorials and documentation.

The goal of this project is to understand the core concepts behind:
- Document loading
- Text chunking
- Embeddings
- Vector databases
- Retrieval and response generation

---

## What I Learned
While building this project, I practiced:
- Setting up a Python environment
- Working with Jupyter notebooks
- Using LangChain and embeddings
- Understanding how RAG systems work internally

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
2. Run cells step by step
3. Install required libraries if missing

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- LangChain  
- Vector Database (Chroma)

---

## Notes
This project is part of my learning journey in:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM applications
- AI-powered document processing
