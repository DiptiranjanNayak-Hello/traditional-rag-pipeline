A wireless router combines three devices in one: a router, a \\nnetwork switch, and a wireless access point. This makes it ideal for small networks \\nsuch as homes and small offices. \\n\\uf0b7 A typical wireless router has five Ethernet interfaces. One of these is the Internet \\nport, also known as the Wide Area Network (WAN) port. This port connects the \\nwireless router to an internet modem, allowing internet access for all connected devices. \\nWithout an active internet connection, devices connected to the wireless router can still \\ncommunicate with each other locally but cannot access internet resources. \\n\\uf0b7 A wireless router can create a local network even without an internet connection. \\nDevices connected to the router—either wired or wireless—can still communicate with \\neach other, share files, or use local services because they are on the same network. \\nHowever, without an active connection to an internet service provider, the router cannot \\nforward traffic to the internet, so devices are unable to access websites, online services, \\nor cloud-based resources. \\n\\uf0b7 The remaining Ethernet ports function as a built-in network switch. These ports allow \\ndevices to connect using wired Ethernet connections. The switch forwards data frames \\nbetween wired devices and also between wired and wireless devices, enabling full \\ncommunication across the entire network. \\n\\uf0b7 In addition, the wireless router includes a built-in access point that broadcasts radio \\nsignals in the 2.4 GHz and/or 5 GHz frequency bands. This allows wireless clients \\nsuch as laptops and smartphones to connect to the network. \\n\\uf0b7 The router functionality enables communication between wired and wireless networks \\nand also supports advanced services such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \\n(DHCP) server. DHCP automatically assigns network settings—including IP address, \\nsubnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses—to all connected devices. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of a wireless network. It allows \\nwireless devices to distinguish one wireless network from another. Without SSIDs, \\nusers would find it difficult to identify which network they should connect to. \\n\\uf0b7 Home users and organizations usually change the default SSID provided by the device \\nmanufacturer to a more recognizable name. However, as a security best practice, \\norganizations should avoid using SSIDs that clearly identify the organization or attract \\nattackers.'),\n",

It helps track deliverables and approvals, automate workflows using AI, manage \\nteams and content, and handle payments transparently.

Creators or brands can start a \\ncampaign by uploading a campaign brief such as a PDF or by using a drag-and-drop \\nworkflow builder. Influcraft’s AI reads the brief, extracts deliverables, builds a structured \\nworkflow, assigns tasks, sets timelines, and tracks progress from both the creator and brand \\nside. This system is directly integrated with Creator Studio if the creator is working with a \\nteam. Once both sides agree on the terms and deliverables, the brand deposits the full \\ncampaign amount into Influcraft’s escrow system. Payments are linked to deliverables, and \\nas soon as the deliverables and conditions are met, the system automatically releases the \\npayment to the creator. \\nInflucraft also provides a Creator CMS where creators manage their entire digital presence \\nfrom one dashboard. They can run blogs, newsletters, content scheduling, and content \\ncalendars, along with personalized and domain-mapped websites, link-in-bio pages, and \\nURL shorteners. This allows creators to operate like a real media business instead of using \\nmultiple disconnected tools. \\nFor creators who manage teams, Influcraft offers Creator Studio. It is a space where editors, \\ndesigners, writers, and managers can collaborate. It supports task assignment, file sharing, \\nteam communication, and is deeply integrated with the AI Workflow Automation system so \\nthat campaign work and team work stay in sync.It supports escrow-based campaign'),\n",

This \\ncreates messy workflows, delayed approvals, payment confusion, and zero automation. \\nCreators do not have proper systems to manage campaigns, teams, content, and money in \\none place. Influcraft fixes this by giving creators a single intelligent platform to manage \\ncampaigns, content, teams, and payments using AI-driven automation. Influcraft is not a \\ncreator marketplace or discovery platform. \\nWhat Does Influcraft Do? \\nInflucraft provides creators and brands a structured system to execute campaigns \\nend-to-end. It helps track deliverables and approvals, automate workflows using AI, manage \\nteams and content, and handle payments transparently.

In simple words, Influcraft replaces \\nchaos with systems. \\nPlatform & Core Features \\nThe core of Influcraft is its AI Workflow Automation engine. Creators or brands can start a \\ncampaign by uploading a campaign brief such as a PDF or by using a drag-and-drop \\nworkflow builder. Influcraft’s AI reads the brief, extracts deliverables, builds a structured \\nworkflow, assigns tasks, sets timelines, and tracks progress from both the creator and brand \\nside. This system is directly integrated with Creator Studio if the creator is working with a \\nteam. Once both sides agree on the terms and deliverables, the brand deposits the full \\ncampaign amount into Influcraft’s escrow system. Payments are linked to deliverables, and \\nas soon as the deliverables and conditions are met, the system automatically releases the \\npayment to the creator. \\nInflucraft also provides a Creator CMS where creators manage their entire digital presence'),\n",
